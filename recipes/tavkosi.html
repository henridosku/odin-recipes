    <h3>Tave Kosi Recipe</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Being able to cook an Albanian national dish that reminds everyone of home puts a great smile on my face and warmth in my heart. 
        <br>Albanian Tavë kosi is a simple recipe of baked lamb and yogurt with rice, seasoned with oregano and garlic.
        <br>The recipe originates from the Albanian city Elbasan so is also known as Tavë Elbasani.
        Some see Tavë Kosi as a comfort food dish.
    </p>
    <p>
        The soft, tender lamb baked with rice, oregano and garlic underneath a yogurt mixture has the most amazing aroma.
        <br> looks impressive when cooking too, the top rises up above the pot then as it cools sinks to create an impressive golden delight. 
        <br> Most recipes call for lamb shoulder meat to be used however 
        <br> I find cutting up the meat of a leg of lamb works well too, I keep the bones for the next day, boiling them to make stock or soup.

    <h5>Ingridients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>600g Diced Lamb</li>
        <li>20g Butter</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>70g Rice</li>
        <li>2 Tsp Oregano</li>
        <li>450ml Boiling Water</li>
        <li>2 Cloves Diced Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Baking the lamb</li>
        <p>In a large pan (with a lid) melt the butter and olive oil together then add the diced lamb. 
        <br> Brown the lamb on a medium heat, this will take around 5 minutes.</p>
        <li>Add garlic</li>
        <p>Add the garlic, oregano, 300ml of water and season with salt and pepper. Mix well before covering with the lid. 
        <br> Leave to simmer for 50 minutes mixing a couple of times ensuring the lamb doesn’t start to burn.</p>
        <li>Mix all together</li>
        <p>The juices should have nearly all boiled away so another 150ml of water should be added along with the rice. 
        <br>Mix altogether, bring to the boil, place the lid on and leave for just 10 minutes. 
        <br>It’s advised to check at around 8 minutes – you want the liquid to be evaporated with just moist coating of 
        <br>oily water left over the lamb and rice.</p>
        <li>Mixin the eggs with yogurt</li>
        <p>In a mixing bowl add the yogurt, eggs and season with salt and pepper. 
        <br>Mix together then add the roux continuing to mix fast for a minute to 
        <br>ensure the roux and yogurt are thoroughly combined.</p>
        <li>Almost there</li>
        <br>Place on the bottom shelf of the oven on 180 degrees for 35 minutes then 
        <br>move it up to the middle for a further 10 minutes. The Tavë kosi is ready 
        <br>when the yogurt has risen up high and a golden crust formed.
